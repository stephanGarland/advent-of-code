# Advent of Code

My personal [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) repo. It's far from complete, but I have templates ready to go for every day.

I'll also note that in no way should any of this be taken as best practices. In fact, they usually aren't. I like finding interesting ways to accomplish the tasks (as long as they aren't massively slow) to learn more about Python.

No puzzle inputs are to be found here, as those remain the [copyright](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) of Advent of Code. The solutions are freely available, such as they are.

## bootstrap.py

Bootstrap attempts to, well, bootstrap a repo. It can create a new year structure, download your unique puzzle inputs, and throw some basic code templates together. It relies on [advent-of-code-data](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data) for some of its functionality, as does every template for submittals.
